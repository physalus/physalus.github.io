![Hypothetical Blue Whale sensory detection range](/images/detectionRange.png "Detection Range Schematic")
Hypothetical depiction of a predator’s search behavior outside (blue track in left panel, top right panel) and inside (red track in left panel, bottom right panel) the sensory detection range. A shift to directed movement toward the stimulus is predicted once the predator enters the sensory detection range (red dashed line in left panel). *Adapted from: Hein, A.M., Martin, B.T.
